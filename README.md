Objective 

To analyse whether fatal police encounters are associated more strongly with neighborhood-level socioeconomic conditions than with individual-level characteristics.


Key findings:

Black victims are more likely to be killed in area where higher black population share. And also it happen mostly in area that has lower education rate. Area that has lower income encounters fatality.

Interpretation:

=> Do fatal police encounters cluster in economically and racially stratified area?

•	Fatal encounters disproportionately occur in lower-income neighbourhoods.

•	Victim race does not always align with area racial majority — suggesting mobility across neighbourhood types.

•	Armed status does not vary significantly by neighbourhood wealth — challenging assumptions about crime-income correlation.

•	Incidents cluster in areas with lower educational attainment.

Tools Used

•	Python

•	Pandas (data cleaning, grouping)

•	NumPy

•	Seaborn / Matplotlib

•	Census-tract level aggregation logic

 Conclusion
 
The analysis suggests that fatal police encounters are not randomly distributed geographically. They are disproportionately concentrated in census tracts characterized by lower income, lower educational attainment, and higher poverty levels. This pattern indicates that structural socioeconomic conditions may play a significant role in shaping the geography of lethal encounters.
